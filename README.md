This project is a neural network simulation 
The code creates a neural network architecture that:
Implements a fully-connected feedforward neural network from scratch in C
Supports configurable network structures with multiple layers and variable neurons per layer
Uses sigmoid activation functions for all neurons
Includes randomized initial weights and biases
Has two testing modes: a "simple" network (with a small structure) and a "big" network (with many more neurons and layers)
